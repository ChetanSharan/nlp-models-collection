# GPT for Quora data

Here you will see how to use GPT model for Questions and Answers generated from the Quora dataset.

## Installations

GPT model needs the following packages, install those using the pip command.

**1. Transformers:** Transformers provides thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on different modalities such as text, vision, and audio.

**2. Datasets:** Datasets is a library for easily accessing and sharing datasets for Audio, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

**3. PyTorch:** PyTorch provides two high-level features: Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration along with Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system

**4. Accelerate:** Accelerate is created for PyTorch users who like to write the training loop of PyTorch models but are reluctant to write and maintain the boilerplate code needed to use multi-GPUs/TPU/fp16.

`pip install transformers datasets torch accelerate`
